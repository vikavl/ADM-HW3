The decor here is elegant with the occasional rustic touch, while the service is of the highest level yet pleasantly friendly and informal. Welcome to Bartolini’s Maremma restaurant! Here, resident chef Bruno De Moura Cossio offers a choice of dishes with one common denominator, namely charcoal grilling. All the dishes served here have been grilled in some way, so that they have a distinctive barbecued flavour. However, although the chef’s Brazilian origins are obvious in many different ways, the ingredients are resolutely local, some even from the restaurant’s own farm. The friendly service makes guests feel completely at home, while the excellent wine selection is an added attraction – those produced on the estate itself are highly recommended.

62	50 Kalò	piazza Sannazzaro 201/b	Naples	80122	Italy	€	Pizza	In the Neapolitan tradition of interpreting dreams, 50 means bread (dough), while the word “kalò” has Greek origins and means good – the name “good dough” explains the secret behind the pizzas made by Ciro Salvo, one of the most famous pizza masters in Naples. This chef makes traditional Neapolitan pizzas, which are large in size and have a soft dough. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations – if it’s busy you just leave your name and wait to be called. However, if you prefer not to wait, there’s a second restaurant at 2, Piazza della Repubblica where you can book ahead of time.

Regional recipes and seasonal local ingredients take pride of place, accompanied by wines chosen with enthusiasm by Elena, Fabrizia’s daughter, including an excellent selection by the glass.

96	Osteria Arbustico	via Francesco Gregorio 40	Paestum	84047	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Campanian	Housed within the Royal Paestum hotel, this elegant, contemporary restaurant boasts an attractively simple and minimalist ambience in which owner-chef Cristian Torsiello’s cuisine takes centre stage. This 40-year-old chef (originally from Valva, a district of Salerno where the Osteria was first opened) showcases creative ideas and techniques in his search for perfect combinations. His deceptively simple dishes always allow the flavour of his locally sourced ingredients to shine through – his iconic spaghetti with saffron is a perfect example. For this dish, he prepares dried Gragnono pasta in the same way as a risotto, using a broth made with one-third beef stock, one-third parmesan cheese and one-third onions. He then blends this with sour butter and Abruzzo saffron to create a dish that is truly delicious and seemingly simple, despite its complex preparation. The wine list continues to evolve, boasting some 600 labels and including a few rare regional wines.

97	Osteria Arborina	frazione Annunziata 27/b	La Morra	12064	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	Although the beautiful Arborina Relais boasts modern, stylish and elegant dining rooms, the main attraction here is the restaurant’s exciting cuisine in which different culinary styles and techniques are showcased in every dish. Inspiration comes from different influences – for example, we chose a menu inspired by the 1980s (a period when Neapolitan chef Fernando Tommaso Forino was not yet born), and particularly enjoyed the mullet in vodka and the dessert trolley. We also liked the idea behind the menu as a whole, namely the no-waste focus, with all parts of the ingredients used yet always with the aim of creating enjoyable dishes. An interesting, classically extensive wine list and excellent service complete the picture.

At the gourmet Prezioso restaurant, in fine weather lucky diners can choose to sit on one of the most spectacular terraces in Italy, perched high above the valley. In the kitchen, chef Egon Heiss demonstrates his culinary talent on a single tasting menu of creative dishes which are made mostly from local mountain ingredients, sourced from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden and other producers from the nearby mountain valleys. The menu nearly always features char and trout, as well as wild game and top-quality meat – the Val di Funes lamb served in two courses (the first as a pink fillet served with its own jus and confit tomatoes, the second a mouthwatering shoulder of lamb with aromatic herbs served with parsley polenta) is truly delicious.

To the rear of the dining room, the large open-view kitchen framed by a superb yellow Siena marble wall is home to chef Gaetano Trovato (Mentor Chef Award 2024) and his team. Although there are three tasting menus available, one of which is vegetarian, any of the courses can also be chosen à la carte style. We could say so much about Arnolfo’s cuisine, but we’ll limit ourselves to mentioning the bread (which has been central to this chef’s work from the very beginning), duck, Chianina beef, Valdarno chicken and the ice-cream which always features among the desserts. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the delightful amuse-bouche with which guests are welcomed, the caponata with Taggiasca olives and basil, and the mullet served with white asparagus, peas and mint. The wine list is impressive, both for its quality and for the extensive selection of wines not only from Italy and France but also from other countries around the world – 7,000 different labels in total.

Both menus showcase local ingredients prepared with technical expertise to create contemporary, Mediterranean dishes that are full of flavour. Onofrio is not afraid to use the occasional French sauce, as well as his beloved fermentations in his dishes. As a final flourish, the desserts come courtesy of Gianluca Colucci, the pastry chef shared with Tenerumi. After enjoying a first, delicious dessert in the dining room, guests move to the “pasticceria” corner where pastry chefs “improvise” a final dessert in line with guests’ preferences. Last but not least, the restaurant boasts a superb setting within the Therasia Resort perched on the Vulcanello promontory above the sea, with breathtaking views of the Aeolian islands often enhanced by blazing sunsets.

Dishes often include combinations that will sound unusual to you, but instead of picking these apart and thinking about the individual components, try to savour their complex, contrasting and yet harmonious flavours. As a result, this new and extraordinary experience will introduce you to some remarkable and occasionally unforgettable dishes. In addition to the musical backdrop (which provides the perfect soundtrack to the cuisine), special mention should be made of the wine pairings that come courtesy of business partner Enrico Maglio, who oversees the carefully researched and surprising wine list. The partnership with various local suppliers, which helps to showcase the region’s produce, is also highly commendable.

Here, Flavio creates imaginative cuisine that harmoniously combines ingredients from Piedmont (meat) and Liguria (fish), as well as more contemporary combinations. We particularly enjoyed the pigeon, turnip greens and sweetcorn, as well as the chocolate, sweet beetroot and coconut dessert. In season, there’s also a menu featuring game dishes.

Situated in the heart of the Sassi district, the restaurant enjoys the perfect location for a post-dinner stroll through one of Italy’s most charming historic centres, especially at night when the soft light gives the town a haunting appearance when viewed from the belvedere at Piazza Duomo. The chef demonstrates a strong connection with the region through his cuisine, often choosing recipes and ingredients from Lucania and then interpreting these with a freedom that results in personalised and creative dishes. His creations (some of which are long-established old favourites) showcase the traditions of the region in a way that also appeals to the tastes of contemporary diners (many of whom are from outside Italy), ably assisted by the excellent Donato, his long-time colleague front of house. We particularly enjoyed the tuna tartare with a “corteccia di crapiata” (a local green soup which he serves with a crispy texture), smoked olive oil and red onion ice-cream; the “calamarro” (squid stuffed with lamb entrails) and the “Monte Crusko” dessert with its elegant crusco pepper ice-cream.

If you’re a fan of fish and seafood, try the stew which is made using delicately flavoured fish and a cream sauce, and served with blanched seasonal vegetables and traditional Tuscan crostino. Front of house, Valeria is ably assisted by son Andrea, who oversees the well-stocked wine cellar featuring a selection of different Brunello and Barolo vintages, as well as Bordeaux-style Tuscan labels, all at excellent prices.

Here, the chef’s “Cook the Mountain” philosophy takes centre stage with a focus on top-quality produce sourced from the surrounding mountains, and a seasonal approach which ensures that flavours and ingredients are always at their best. Dinner starts with delicious appetisers served in the small lounge, perhaps accompanied by an aperitif. Having enjoyed this delicious prelude, you then move to the dining room or to the counter with its stools facing the kitchen. Wherever you choose to sit, you continue with the chef’s single tasting menu – a series of superb dishes that confirm this chef from the Ahrntal valley as one of the masters of contemporary Italian cuisine.

At the helm in the kitchen, chef Luca Sacchi (ably assisted by owner Carlo) creates top-quality cuisine with impeccable technique, inspired by the culinary traditions of Milan and the broader Mediterranean with fish from Liguria taking pride of place on the menu – the chef also has a new restaurant in Portofino. The wine list is an experience in itself, offering one of the best and most comprehensive selections of French wines in Italy, as well as an excellent choice of wines by the glass. Guests also have the opportunity to taste wines from the organic Vistamare estate situated in the Romagnole hills. The professional career of the chef at Cracco is one of the most impressive in Italy, with influences that include the culinary master Alain Ducasse and wine expert Giorgio Pinchiorri. The most popular tables are those by the window with views of the Ottagono building.

The inspiration for his “History of venison and ChatGPT in the Parco dello Stelvio with pomegranate, celery, pepper and juniper” dish is the region’s deer management plan and responsible venison consumption. The excellent wine cellar is home to over 800 different labels carefully selected by owner Marco Masè alongside long-established sommelier Giuseppe Greco, plus a wide array of gin and tonics.

721	Venissa	fondamenta Santa Caterina 3	Mazzorbo	30142	Italy	€€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Far away from the tourist hordes, Venissa is situated in a small walled vineyard dating back to the Middle Ages – complete with 14C belltower – on the small island of Mazzorbo, a magical setting which is perfect for a short stroll before settling down to eat. In addition to the Dorona di Venezia vineyard, the restaurant also has a kitchen garden which provides most of its vegetables, including unusual varieties such as “castraure”, a type of local artichoke. Once out of the garden, you come to a small wooden bridge which links Mazzorbo to neighbouring Burano, where you can complete your visit to the lagoon by exploring the lacemakers’ shops and admiring the colourful local houses. The main focus here, however, is the cuisine – and excellent cuisine it is too! Chefs Chiara Pavan and Francesco Brutto describe their dishes as “ambientale” (environmental) because of the close connection between the lagoon and the Upper Adriatic: the menu features plenty of fish and vegetables and almost no meat. Guests choose their number of courses and the dishes come as a surprise, accompanied by organic wine pairings. At the Osteria Contemporanea next door the dishes are simpler but still full of flavour.

This partnership has strengthened the style of Bistrot, which is somewhere between traditional and modern in feel and where the quality of the ingredients has always been of utmost importance. The restaurant is particularly renowned for its excellent fish, most of which comes from the Tyrrhenian sea, while it also boasts two wood-fired ovens in which the chef bakes different, truly delicious breads and cooks some of his dishes. The wine selection is a further attraction – the beautiful wine cellar is home to just under 2 000 different labels, with the choice of champagnes and Burgundy wines meriting special mention.

The whole place is designed to provide an enjoyable gourmet experience, from the friendly welcome to the sofas and armchairs where guests can sit and enjoy an aperitif accompanied by some enticing appetisers. With the passing of time, Brunel has proven to be ever more skilful in showcasing the Trentino to Italy and the rest of the world, sometimes in nikkei-style dishes, and sometimes in more Mediterranean fare with the occasional flight of fantasy inspired by the chef’s passion for Italian poet Gabriele D’Annunzio. Front of house, the equally brilliant Christian Rainer provides recommendations from the excellent wine list with an acclaimed professionalism that knows few equals.

1092	La Caravella dal 1959	via Matteo Camera 12	Amalfi	84011	Italy	€€€€	Campanian, Mediterranean Cuisine	La Caravella’s history is intricately linked to that of gastronomic tourism on the Amalfi Coast, so much so that it’s impossible to mention all the famous personalities who have dined here and fallen in love with the Dipino family’s cuisine. The food is proudly inspired by local and family traditions, while at the same time constantly seeking to reinterpret these traditions and create new imaginative recipes. Examples include pears cooked in Aglianico wine served with raw shrimps and cow’s ricotta cheese, and raw fish and seafood options accompanied by a careful selection of seasonal vegetables. Two important features here are the focus on simple, traditional cooking techniques and the speed of preparation. The menu showcases the best of the area’s fresh fish, including pezzogna (a variety of sea bream), swordfish and tuna, supplemented when necessary by options from the nearby Cilento region. Other ingredients include tomatoes (which feature in almost half the dishes), Amalfi’s famous lemons (the classic lemon soufflé is highly recommended), basil and Agerola bread – you’ll want to order almost everything on the menu! The excellent wine list features reds, whites, sparkling, sweet, young and vintage wines, with legendary labels such as La Tâche listed alongside smaller, unknown, rare and organic wines. Whatever your preference, sommelier Tonino has that rare talent (also found at the Enoteca Pinchiorri) of finding just the right wine for you.

Chef Matteo now offers a new surprise menu, where guests simply decide on the number of courses they want (usually three, five or eight) and he does the rest, creating delicious cuisine prepared from the best ingredients available in the market that day – which means, of course, that the dishes can change daily. What remains unchanged, however, is his expertise and his intention to serve ingredients without adding unnecessary frills, just the occasional Asian twist thanks to his previous experience working in China. Elena continues to welcome guests and oversee the front of house, assisted by the sommelier and an impressive wine list. The bread here is also excellent.

His modern dishes aim to reflect the ancestral flavours of Brianza and Lombardy in bygone days when hunting, freshwater fishing, growing vegetables and gathering wild herbs were all part of everyday life. In the evening, choose between three tasting menus – in an effort to minimise food waste, guests are required to make their choice at the time of booking. We particularly enjoyed the quail served with its own broth and a brioche, and the gnocchi with stracchino cheese, caramel and venison bottarga. Lighter and less expensive options are available at lunchtime, as well as a convivial table for eight which can be shared with “strangers”.

At the end of your journey, you arrive at an elegant late-18C villa with its adjoining old olive-oil mill that houses this restaurant crowned by a typical cross-vaulted ceiling.

The focus here is on Calabrian ingredients (pigeon and oysters are sourced from outside the region), with produce such as the excellent extra-virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs and vegetables produced on the property, all transformed into creative and original dishes in front of guests by the skilful chefs. After your meal, you may like to move to the beautiful Aspro Cocktail Bar for a coffee, a small pastry or a cocktail. If you wish to prolong your stay, accommodation is now available in Casa Qafiz.

The cuisine comes courtesy of Alfonso Crescenzo, whose slogan “Nothing is more complex than simple cuisine” lies behind his tasteful reinterpretations of Campania’s traditional dishes, which are natural, full of generous flavours and beautifully presented.

Also well worth sampling is the cuttlefish risotto alla pescatora served as an appetiser and the tortelli maremmani with concentrated apricot and rosehip-infused broth.

1380	Unforgettable	via Lorenzo Valerio 5/b	Turin	10122	Italy	€€€€	Innovative, Italian Contemporary	Although it seems incredible today, this restaurant in central Turin, situated just a stone’s throw from the Santuario della Consolata, stands on a street that once marked the boundary between the town and the surrounding countryside – to highlight the fact, after ringing the doorbell you make your way into what was once a farmhouse. Despite this traditional setting, chef Christian Mandura’s focus here is creative and occasionally extremely imaginative with dishes presented on a long tasting menu inspired by his varied experience. Having been greeted by the chefs in the kitchen, guests are then served at a counter where they sit side by side (there are ten seats in total). Vegetables take centre stage in Mandura’s dishes, with fish and meat usually served as an accompaniment, although if you prefer a menu based exclusively on one type of meat you can book the Paradigma dining room. There is also an original and personalised selection of drinks by the glass (not just wine) sourced by sommelier Jacopo from small-scale producers, including an excellent choice of vermouths.

She named her restaurant after the travelling salesman and the name has been kept in his memory. In a typical setting of stone walls and old rural objects from bygone days, Hélène is now front-of-house taking care of guests, while Nadia Mongiat has replaced her in the kitchen, where she continues with the restaurant’s tradition of creating simple Tuscan cuisine. The focus here is on preparing ingredients in traditional ways, such as pork liver (the thinnest part of the liver is used) cooked at a low temperature and then stored in lard with fennel for a few days before being re-heated sous-vide in a bain-marie. As a result, the liver (served lukewarm on a bed of Tuscan green beans) is soft and delicious.

The dishes are divided between those which pay tribute to the traditions of the region (don’t miss the “plin”) and others which showcase the chef’s personal style, including a menu dedicated to the barbecue grill. The latter is even used in some of the sweets, such as the smoky-flavoured bread and chocolate dessert. The wine list demonstrates the same affection for Piedmont, as well as featuring a selection of champagnes. During the day, enjoy the splendid view through the picture windows that surround the dining room, which also boasts a large fireplace.

Passion and consistency are the characteristics that have drawn guests to this restaurant for over a century: the cuisine makes full use of regional ingredients in dishes that have occasionally been reinterpreted with a modern twist. Some guests may prefer the modern dining room, although regulars may well choose the more rustic-style room, where two of the tables are laid out right in front of the fireplace. There’s a good selection of wine, plus a few simple guestrooms on the upper floors.

1575	Octavin	scalinata Camillo Berneri 2	Arezzo	52100	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Housed in two small dining rooms connected by an arch on the ground floor of an old palazzo, this restaurant is decorated with materials that give it a minimalist feel – a combination of stone, wood and iron in the tables, glass in the mirrors and bottles on display, and paper in the books arranged in small niches, just like the lounge of a private home. There are just 20 seats in this warm, intimate and unfussy restaurant, as well as a large counter separated by an arch at the entrance which precedes the recently restructured kitchen. Observation of his own region has shown owner-chef Luca Fracassi that the varied geography of his province is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. As a result, he has embarked upon an impassioned search for ingredients that best showcase the region, combining these in dishes that not only respect the flavours of his produce but also revive traditional local techniques and include the occasional oriental influence. His cuisine is modern yet eschews modern trends, paying careful attention to integrity of flavour and zero waste. In this way, the kitchen becomes a place in which wild ingredients and forgotten flavours are rediscovered and brought back to life. This focus on lost traditions combines ingredients such as snails and game (often neglected in urban restaurants) with a skilful and updated use of contemporary culinary techniques.

There are two dining options here: the tasting menus showcase the chef’s creativity and precise techniques to the full in courses referred to as “provocazioni”, which focus on the use of just a few ingredients per dish. The second option is the à la carte, which features dishes that demonstrate the generous, classic flavours of the 1980s – for example, the main ingredient in these dishes is often served with an array of small bowls containing accompanying ingredients. The service is also more classic in feel, involving the addition of table linen and period-style glasses, plates and even chairs. Both options, of course, are created by the same chef with the same intention, which is to guide guests through an amusing culinary playground in which boredom and banality have been completely banished. It’s no coincidence that the background music is accompanied by a pleasant play of colourful effects.

Another room (Pistoletto), simpler and more informal in feel, can be found behind its more historic sibling.

The iconic appetisers featuring countless delicious ingredients are a feast for the eyes and the tastebuds alike and were particularly enjoyed by our inspectors. It hardly needs mentioning that this region is passionate about wine, so it’s not entirely surprising that the restaurant offers three different wine lists: Solopiemonte pays superb homage to the region, while Tuttoilresto (divided into two options, white and red) is a celebration of French wines. The efficient and enthusiastic serving staff succeed in taking good care of guests without being excessively formal, so that three hours (roughly the amount of time you need to allow for your meal) pass almost without noticing.

1900	Saporium	località Palazzetto 110	Chiusdino	53012	Italy	€€€€	Tuscan, Italian Contemporary	Saporium is the new fine-dining restaurant at the superb Relais Borgo Santo Pietro, an old property where the internal decor demonstrates a rare elegance, especially in the evening when hundreds of candles provide soft lighting and a romantic ambience in the dining room. In fine weather, meals are served under an elegant 13C portico overlooking the garden, with the property’s 100ha grounds and the Valle Serena as a backdrop. Much of the produce used in the cuisine (designed by executive chef Ariel Hagan and transformed by resident chef Luca Ottogalli into modern, delicate dishes) comes from the hotel’s own olive groves, vineyards, orchards and vegetable gardens. The focus here is on seasonal ingredients from this extraordinary region – the saddle of hare with cavolo nero and pear is a perfect example! A whole host of wine-pairing options are possible thanks to a wine list featuring over 1 300 labels. We recommend trying one of the Borgo’s own wines, such as the harmonious and elegant Pinot Nero.

The fine cuisine celebrated here includes historic dishes that have become classic favourites, which can be chosen from the three tasting menus. A good example is the beef cooked with olive oil and served with polenta: “Nonna” Elvira made this dish in the post-war period and her grandson Stefano follows the same recipe today. The menu also includes a few fish dishes, while wine-enthusiasts shouldn’t hesitate to ask sommelier Federica for her recommendations – they won’t regret it!

Their individual talents come together in the natural and engaging welcome they offer guests, demonstrating a warmth and professionalism that is typical of the Kuppelrain experience. Chef Kevin, who is as skilful as his father Jorg (now front of house), demonstrates precise, excellent techniques in his search for comforting and appealing flavours that bring out the full flavour of his ingredients with no frills or unnecessary fuss. Local produce takes pride of place, such as fruit and vegetables from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden, and meat and fish from the region. The desserts, as well as the imaginative pralines, are made by daughter Natalie. Wine-enthusiasts will also be in their element here, thanks to the excellent wine list (including a fine selection by the glass, as well as magnums and 3-litre double magnums) which is overseen by talented Sonya (the winner of the 2022 Michelin Sommelier Award!), who creates unique wine pairings.

His decidedly personalised cuisine can be paired with original vegetable cocktails (most of which are non-alcoholic), although wine-enthusiasts will be pleased to hear that a wine list is also available.
